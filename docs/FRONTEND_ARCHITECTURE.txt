Frontend Architecture (DigiMart)
================================

Overview
--------
The frontend is a Vite + React (JSX) app using an atomic, reusable component
structure. It mirrors the backend features: authentication, tenant dashboard,
store management, and user management.

Core Structure
--------------
src/
  App.jsx               - App shell, auth flow, role-based routing.
  main.jsx              - React bootstrap.
  index.css             - Global styles.

components/
  ui/                   - Atomic reusable building blocks
    Button, TextInput, Modal, ConfirmDialog
  layout/               - Global layout parts
    Navbar, Sidebar, TenantNavbar, TenantSidebar
  stores/               - Store cards
  users/                - User cards

layouts/
  AdminLayout           - Platform admin dashboard layout.
  TenantLayout          - Tenant dashboard layout (navbar + sidebar + content).

pages/
  auth/                 - Login + registration (2-step tenant creation).
  dashboard/            - Landing dashboard content.
  stores/               - Store management UI.
  users/                - User management + roles/permissions UI.

Routing and State
-----------------
- Lightweight client routing managed in App.jsx by state.
- After login:
  - SUPER_ADMIN -> AdminLayout
  - Tenant users -> TenantLayout
- tenantId and userId stored in localStorage.

API Integration
---------------
- Uses fetch to call backend endpoints through Vite proxy.
- Handles token-based auth and error messages from backend.
- For uploads, uses multipart/form-data (store images, tenant logo).

Design Principles
-----------------
Atomic UI
- Small, reusable components in components/ui.
- Page-specific components (StoreCard, UserCard) are isolated.

Responsive Design
- Layout adapts for mobile (sidebar overlay, grid-only on phone).
- Store and user pages support grid/list view toggles, forced grid on mobile.

Consistency
-----------
- Shared visual style across cards and modals.
- Icons via react-icons for uniform action affordances.
